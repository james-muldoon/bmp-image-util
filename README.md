* Name : James Muldoon - u5796521

* Program function:
Taking a picture in BMP format, my program will apply a threshold filter to it (a.k.a black and white) and output the new picture to a new file. Options for the user include specifying the threshold to be used on the picture, the file to be run on, and the name of the output file. The user may also request a help message, which gives details on use of the program.

* How to compile/run:
Included with the program files is a makefile. In the terminal, the program can be compiled using the command '$ make'. To run the program using the default values, the command '$ make run' can be used. To view the result of this run, the command '$ make view' (note: user will need to have program 'feh' installed for this command to work). Finally, the command '$ make clean' will delete the files created during this process. **Needs work.

* Testing:
DO SOME TESTING.

* Extensions:
